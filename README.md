# SentimentAnalysis2ElectricBoogaloo
Continuing sentiment analysis of tweets from ex-prez account.

I was inspired by yesterday's final hearing of the Jan. 6th committee's findings and charges against the impeached one. So, I looked back on the Google Sheets I had of all the tweets from he who shall not be named and decided to see if there was anything curious contained within the tweets leading up to the 2020 Presidential election and what happened afterward up to the Jan 6th insurrection on the Capitol. 

I used Vader for the sentiment analysis but I realize now that's not really sufficicent for what I was looking for/wanted to do. So, I will keep looking for a better library and model to analyze sentiment. This is a WIP.
